Changes with version 0.12                                           20 Apr 2018

	* Feature: Dockerfile added

	* Feature: RPM specification added

Changes with version 0.11                                           22 Feb 2013

	* Feature: command line options "-e" introduced (switch endianness). The
	  standard does not specifies explicitly how to output the resulting hash.
	  This implementation outputs hash in hexadecimal format in order how
	  bytes are represented in memory - least significant first.  With this
	  option set, program outputs digest in hexadecimal format in reversed
	  order - most significant first.

	* Feature: example messages from standard are added in "examples"
	  directory.

	* Feature: set SUPERCOP environment when configuring to prepare this
	  implementation to run on SUPERCOP toolkit.

	* Bugfix: variables, structures, functions changed their names from
	  *GOST3411* to fully-qualified *GOST34112012*
	
	* Bugfix: API: GOST34112012Init() now operates on allocated memory.
	  Previously, memory allocation for context has been done with
	  GOST34112012Init() call - this guarantee proper alignment for context's
	  members.  As for now, alignment is done with ALIGN keyword in object
	  declaration and GOST34112012Init() does not allocate any byte of memory.
	
	* Bugfix: API: GOST34112012Final() now returns digest in memory pointed by
	  second argument.  Context member "hexdigest" not used anymore thus
	  abandoned.  It is up to calling application to present digest in
	  hexadecimal (or any) format.

Changes with version 0.10                                           29 Jan 2013

	* Feature: performance optimization in substitution S: perform
	  substitution by Pi[] while generating multiplication lookup table.
	  Lookup table arranged in a such way totally eliminates the need to do
	  whole S-cycle in LPS.
	
	* Feature: use SSE4.1 instructions set in LPS if available.

	* Feature: multiplication lookup table is now statically precomputed in
	  header file and is in constant memory.
	
	* Bugfix: rewrite GOST3411Update() function to implement streaming mode
	  when processing large amount of data.
	
	* Bugfix: rename round2() and round3() to stage2() and stage3()
	  respectively.
	
	* Bugfix: in auto configuration probes: delete temporary files.

Changes with version 0.09                                           22 Jan 2013

	* Feature: internal data flow and representation rewritten so that whole
	  internal state of compression function g() is hold in two XMM-register
	  quadruples.  This avoid copying of temporary key and internal state
	  between rounds in g(), thus reduce instructions count per plaintext
	  block.
	
	* Feature: with code optimization above, performance on 32-bit systems
	  greatly improved and is now about as fast as with 64-bit systems.
	
	* Feature: detect MMX and SSE2 capabilities on compile time and use faster
	  code when possible.  From this version onward there are at least two
	  versions of implementation: portable (not using any extensions like MMX
	  or SSE) and optimized one.

	* Feature: big-endian systems compatibility.

	* Bugfix: in function g(): unload function's output directly to it's
	  internal state, thus avoid one extra memcpy() call per plaintext block.

	* Bugfix: integer overflow incorrectly handled in addition by modulo 2.
	  This could lead to incorrect results on some files.
	
Changes with version 0.08                                           19 Jan 2013

	* Feature: boost performance on 32-bit systems by using 64-bit MMX XOR
	  instructions in XLPS.

	* Feature: Use 128-bit SSE2 for X on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.  For
	  latter this will decrease number of instructions in about two times when
	  XORing 512-bit block.

Changes with version 0.07                                           17 Jan 2013

	* Feature: boost performance on 32-bit systems by using SSE2.

	* Bugfix: padding function rewritten to less complex.

	* Bugfix: key generation function K replaced with XLPS macros to avoid
	  inlining issues when max inline instruction limit reached.
	
	* Bugfix: encryption function E inlined to compression g to avoid
	  compile-time inlining issues when max inline instruction limit reached.
	
	* Bugfix: use unsigned integers where possible.

	* Bugfix: fix typo in update() when comparing bufsize.

	* Bugfix: memory allocator rewritten to use posix_memalign().

Changes with version 0.06                                           09 Jan 2013
	
	* Feature: performance optimization in LPS: hint compiler to use eight
	  registers instead of union buffer.
	
	* Feature: performance optimization in permutation P: rotate matrix by
	  cyclic right shifting bits in source matrix columns to rows in
	  destination matrix.
	
	* Feature: as result of previous two optimizations: replace LPS macros
	  with improved macros XLPS.

	* Bugfix: improve constant table C presentation to avoid runtime
	  conversion in key generator K.
	
	* Bugfix: unroll key generation loop in E.

	* Bugfix: rename union member names according to their natural meaning.

Changes with version 0.05                                           24 Dec 2012

	* Feature: issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C.

	* Feature: performance optimization in LPS: execute substitution and
	  permutation within single loop.

Changes with version 0.04                                           17 Dec 2012

	* Bugfix: fixed memory leaks (make valgrind happy).

	* Bugfix: update code to work on 32-bit systems.

	* Bugfix: code improvement in Key generator K.

	* Feature: performance optimization in linear transformation L (based on
	  Assembler instructions generated by CLang).

Changes with version 0.03                                           16 Dec 2012

	* Bugfix: algorithm optimization in linear transformation L.

Changes with version 0.02                                           15 Dec 2012

	* Feature: Makefile improvements.

	* Bugfix: recent GCC version compatibility (GCC 4.7).

	* Bugfix: layout modification: isolate core from main program.

	* Bugfix: handle read errors with ferror().

Initial version 0.01                                                14 Dec 2012
